[jmej](http://www.anestheticaudio.com/), [xnor](http://x37v.info)

## Notes

This is a near exact clone of the famous kick drum from the classic tr-808 drum
machine. The only changes are for facilitating the common mods (extended decay
and a pitch pot), and a slightly more flexible trigger input.

This can be triggered by a trigger output of a drum machine, or by a CV/Trigger
from a modular synth, a cmos square wave, or even a loud audio transient.
Alternatively you could wire a switch or button to send the trigger input high
as well. (Basically a quick +V to the trigger input does the job).

It runs on +/- power supply, you can run 2 9v batteries in series, or run it
off a bipolar (+/-15v or +/-12v power supply). Or... experiment!

The accent has a pull-up so if you'll have max volume if its not driven otherwise.

This is an easy and cheap build.
