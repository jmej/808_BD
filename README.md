Eagle files for my version of the 808 Kick drum

Sometimes I sell boards here: https://www.tindie.com/products/jmej/808-kick-drum-clone-pcb/

This is a near exact clone of the famous kick drum from the classic tr-808 drum machine. The only changes are for facilitating the common mods (extended decay and a pitch pot), and a slightly more flexible trigger input.

This can be triggered by a trigger output of a drum machine, or by a CV/Trigger from a modular synth, a cmos square wave, or even a loud audio transient. Alternatively you could wire a switch or button to send the trigger input high as well. (Basically a quick +V to the trigger input does the job).

It runs on +/- power supply, you can run 2 9v batteries in series, or run it off a bipolar (+/-15v or +/-12v power supply). Or... experiment!

This is an easy and cheap build.
